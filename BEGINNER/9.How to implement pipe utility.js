    Is pipe a callback function?
    No, pipe is not a callback function. Instead, pipe is a higher-order function because it:
    
    Takes other functions (fn1, fn2, fn3, ...) as input arguments.
    Returns a new function that can be called later.
    Callbacks, on the other hand, are functions that are passed into another function to be called later as part of that functionâ€™s execution.
    
    ___________________________________________-
    
    pipe as a higher-order function:
    
    It accepts functions as arguments (...functions).
    It returns a new function (the one that takes input).
    
    oneFxn in reduce is a callback:
    
    Inside the reduce method, oneFxn (each function in the pipeline) is a callback because:
    It is passed into reduce and called later with fn(acc).
    Key Distinction
    pipe
    What it is: A higher-order function.
    Purpose: Combines multiple functions into a pipeline.
    fn (inside reduce)
    What it is: A callback function.
    Purpose: Processes the data (acc) step-by-step.
    
    
    ======================
    A higher-order function is a function that:
    
    Takes other functions as arguments, or
    Returns a new function.
    This makes it "higher-order" because it operates on functions, treating them as values.
    Examples: map, filter, reduce, pipe
    Real-Life Example
    Think of Netflix recommendations:
    
    You tell Netflix your preferences (callback function).
    Netflix (higher-order function) uses your preferences to filter and suggest movies.

    Callback Function in JavaScript
    A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed later, either synchronously or asynchronously.
    
    const method = pipe(getName, makeUpperCase, slice); // Passing functions (callbacks)
